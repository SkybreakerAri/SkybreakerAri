<p> And once again, this launch page needs little explanation. From here you can find out about all thirteen  Skills by either scrolling down or using the navigational buttons in the table below. At the top right, you will find three sections other launch screens lack, for the magic system goes unnessecarily in-depth. Tiers refers to the bond a Warrior has with their Guardian, Mastery Levels refers to a Warrior's personal achivements, and Combinations is a list of ability combos with a short explanation. <br> And as for some background... <br>A Warrior is the humanoid alien that possesses the majority of control over the Skill. Their Guardian takes the form of an animal, gives the Warrior the power, and guides them through using it properly. Should the Warrior refuse, the Guardian may leave, or they might die and become Incorpreal. An Incorpreal is a mindless, bodyless being with only faint traces of magic. Should a potential Warrior come in contact with the Incorpreal, they may begin to use that Skill, and, with the right mindset, give the Incorpreal sentinece once more. </p><br><br>

<h2><a id="water">Fire</a></h2><p>In my story, this power is characterized by Rinsta. This power is about control and emotion. Control of the emotions, but not in the sense of supressing them. The Heatraiders creed is to stroke their emotions into a flame without nessecarily acting upon their impulses. As you could guess, this is a very dangerous Skill. In literal words, they absorb heat into themselves and manifest it in the form of fire. Untrained, their emotions will begin to show themselves clearly in the form of fire without the user's consent. Different colors of fire generally point to different emotions. For example, a white fire would denotate anger, yellow happiness, red serenity, and so on. </p><br>
<h2><a id="wind">Water</a></h2><p>In my story, Kalena posses this power, and uses it in some odd ways, due to her situation. When she is bonded to Delano, her Guardian explains that water, being relatively homeostatic, can save her city from a hard, frozen death during the ice age. But in a more literal senese, these Warriors of the Aqueous Ataraxia can control the movement of any liquid. Their order is one of grace and beauty, of changing the movement of things, yet never changing the idea of it.</p><br>
<h2><a id="life">Wind</a></h2><p>Can control/generate the force of wind; think Airbender</p><br>
<h2><a id="i.t">Life</a></h2><p>Controls life force and can force a being to do things. It is far, far easier to do so with plants, and might need either a certin Criterion/Bond with Internal Telesthsia to control sentinent beings.</p><br>
<h2><a id="e.t">Internal Telesthsia</a></h2><p>Telepathy/exploration of the living mind in a large radius
Can see into any living being’s mind. Can only see the minds of beings, not any actual things. He can sort through memories, defenses, emotions, and make someone unconscious, all depending on how well prepared they are. He ends up knowing people far better than he should. They can switch into the "Cognitive" realm, we'll call it (copyright Brandon Sanderson), when a person with this power can throw themselves completely or partially out-of-body and see the world through mental lens. They see conciousness as a glowing orb of light in a white world with no depth. The color of the globe changes with the power of the person/potential for power, and the shape/luminosity changes with the being.<br></p>
<h2><a id="i.mp">External Telesthsia</a></h2><p>Ability to see any object in a large radius, as well as its nature, after some deciphering. Can quite literally see and understand integrally any object within a certain radius. This includes a things relationship with other things, how they fit together, how they help, and how it fits into the overarching system of things. 
But wait. They need to be able to do something with this. How about… rewriting them? She understands them integrally, right? Can she not then… change them? When she is paired with Internal Illusionary, she can change an object's form, because she understands it so well.<br>
</p>
<h2><a id="e.mp">Internal Manipulation</a></h2><p>Can store own emotions, as well as affect other’s emotions
Uses gemstones (perhaps certain kinds for certain things), and requires the physical touch of a predetermined gemstone to a person in order to affect the aforementioned person. When they affect other people’s emotions, they are connected to the person on the same level that they affected them. If you make someone’s emotions disappear, you have to take them upon yourself. For example, if you poof their depression, you now have the full force of the depression. If you give emotions to someone, it has to be just that - you must either pull from your stored emotions or give them your own, losing them yourself. Example: you want to cheer someone up, so you do, but in the process, you yourself grow a little more subdued - not angry, depending on the situation, but less happy. You can muster these emotions as well, of course, because they are your own. You can think of puppies or your family prior to passing happiness to them, or you can remember the last time you were betrayed before giving someone else the anger to fight. The memories and images don’t pass over, only the emotions. You may think this ridiculous until you remember just how real, just how much you justified hormones. You can only store your own emotions. You cannot store emotions thrust upon you, and you cannot store emotions you have taken. It is a sort of test and safelock. You can, however, give others emotions from your storage - that doesn’t change, though it may or may not work, since they may or may not have any reason to feel what you give them. Usually it is an art, a gradual drip of emotions while the Internal Manipulator gives the emotions reason to stay. There is ample reason for their name. So now, this creates sections within the Sector; one for absorbing, one for giving. It requires a certain set of skills each. With the absorbers, they quickly learn how to tell their own emotion from imposters, and once done, can dissuade themselves of the emotions. After all, if you can’t find fuel for the feeling, why keep it? They are masters of sorting through things efficiently and thoroughly, dealing with problems and emotions they never should have known, and debating. They are the healer to all because they have felt the worst possible feelings from all of their friends, trying to help them, and have dealt with it all. They are your psychologists on every level. Not only have they studied the whys, but they have felt it themselves, and can connect the two. However, it can wear a person down. It is a long journey to convince yourself that the crushing emotions are not your own, because they feel so real. You remember hormones, you know what it is like to feel an emotion that tears you up inside, that gives you fuel to lash out at your loved ones, but have no clue why you’re doing it. Perhaps someone forgetting to open the door for you set it off. These people have it hard. But once the trials are over, they can successfully differentiate truth from lies, and are fantastic debaters, and, as I have mentioned, have plenty of job opportunities, official or not. They can take your pain. What better gift is there for the grieving, or for the heartbroken? You understand you should be over it, and they can take the emotion from you. But this is an opportunity, nothing less, nothing more. When they take your emotion, you have two options; use the clarity of mind to sort through your problems and get rid of the pain for real, or return to those dark thoughts in the depth of the night, and go right back down the hole you wish you’d never entered in the first place. This can also be used for negative uses. You can take joy, take silliness, take whatever, and convince them that this is what is real, not the emotions you previously had. Now, the givers have their own set of problems and advantages. These ones may be a little less known, and a little less sought out. These are the healers in their friend group that never get noticed. They go about, often cheery, spreading their joy to all those they encounter. Whether they do it purposefully or as a way to combat loneliness, they can take their emotions and give it to another. Depending, the emotions may come back, but that moment of subduety can be important. Perhaps you do not get the happiness back, and are solemn, or even angry, for the rest of the day? They may start out cheerful, but grow more solemn, more aware of their powers. Or they can store it while they sleep or something, and give that to others, instead of their own emotions. Of course, the emotions may or may not stick, but it gives them a chance and a hope. However, this also has the tempering effect. No matter what path you take, you become more cognizant of your emotions and the emotions of others. You learn to help, or you learn to hurt, you learn to think either way, and you know what results you will bring about exactly. Say you need your troops to be a bit more alert. You can give a large speech, encouraging them, setting fear and angry into their hearts not only with words, but also with Givers along the sidelines, slowly feeding them fear, slowly setting their hearts aflame. There are many uses for this as well, just less humanitarian.</p><br>
<h2><a id="i.p">External Manipulation</a></h2><p>Can store their own physical attributes in gemstones; a particular attribute a gemstone. 
</p><br>
<h2><a id="e.p">Internal Phantasms</a></h2><p>Illusionary appearances. Can make an apparition wherever you please, but it is only a trick of the light - it depends on the presence of it to work. He can do it to whomever he likes, more with practice to make it realistic. You need to have a pretty good idea of how a given person looks at any given time. Often spies, and you have to have some pretty good acting skills for their persona. It can, of course, be anything other than human as well - it just has no physical being, and a simple hand swipe could test its reality. So, trying to conjure balls, which is really just colorful molecules, wouldn’t be believable, no matter how real it looks, and how it seems to bounce, but transforming one’s skin to be darker, or their eyes to be lighter, is a lot easier. Takes some serious skill to make random water molecules change appearance, then move, and may take a couple Criterions to reach. </p><br>
<h2><a id="i.mf">External Phantasms</a></h2><p>Physical appearance
Can physically change herself however she pleases. Takes a healthy deal of knowledge of how different bodies are formed, the willpower to do it and stay in the form, and imagination. Often needs extensive study in biology, anatomy, physiology, or at least a knowledge of your limits. You need nerves and muscles, bones and sinew. You can keep structures analogous, but often will need to tweak a couple things, and you need to know how. You can feel whatever urges the animal form you are in feels, and more often than not, the forms do not like to be forced together. So this takes some willpower. You have to either convince yourself that you are making an entirely new creature (a sphinx, as opposed to a human-eagle-lion cross) or have the mental strength to not care what the urges running through your mind tell you to do. Can only affect herself and her partner (after a certain Criterion and Tier, of course). Often, it has a very slow start. You have to learn how to change subtle things, such as hair, arms, wings, tail, and so on, before you literally chage your being. After that, you can learn specific things, such as a cat. You can master human and cat, then start to meld the two, keeping some things and discarding others. Your Guardian is a part of you, in this Skill. You and your Guardian share a body, but have two brains and personalities. They can often take over or retreat back if needed, and have their own physical form, easy to slip into (think Shallan). If your Guardian is, say, a deer, as a unit, you can switch between human and deer, but only, usually, with consent from the other. If, say, the Warrior gets traumatized, and absolutely refuses to come out, the Guardian steps in, turning their physical appearance to a deer and living like that. When it is one body, usually that mind is also in control, with feedback and opinions from the other person, who isn’t currently in use. In this way, the Internal Illusionaries are dual personas, and have to deal with arguments and a second mind within their own, as well as who can take control. One of them always has the power to override the other, if they sincerely feel it isn’t right. This offense is acceptable if done for the better good to fulfill your Ideals, but if it doesn’t, punishments can be enforced upon the Valorian as a unit. However, an Internal Illusionary can also change form freely, as I mentioned above. This, however, requires the consent of both parties. You either literally cannot change form if the other refuses, or the bond breaks. One of the two, and the latter is insanely difficult. This difficulty and knowledge needed to create new forms is part of what limits them, and makes them at least a little more relatable. Normally, a being can’t just shapeshift into exactly what the team needs in this story. They have polished, say, a mouse, an elephant, and a stork, and they may work with whatever that entails. It is extraordinarily difficult to shapshift into the perfect face for an occasion, and the whole human impersonation is usually the job of the external illusionaries. Specifics are difficult, and they usually have a couple animals that they do, and only those ones, and they take a great deal of practice and knowledge. They can work with what they have. If they are skilled enough, or desperate enough, they can try to become something that tey haven’t practiced, but it is very difficult to get the exact proportions and details correct, and harder to have it correctly envisioned - usually the vision will change to accommodate your current effort, as the mind does, and it comes out all wrong. So their range is proportionate to their experience, as it should be, just drastically so. 
They often have to visualize their creature, and it does favor artists and scholars. An artistic side is favored when you have specific needs (example - you want wings, claws, fangs, and a armored tail, but there isn’t a good animal for it), so you have to imagine a creature that meets them well enough to recreate it, whether that includes sketches, sculptures, or simple memory. The scholar side is called upon to make it happen with knowledge of how to combine each feature, with how to make them functional. </p><br>
<h2><a id="e.mf">Internal Manifestation</a></h2></p>Can control inanimate things with their minds. Very similar to the Life element but inverted, I know. Some Skills bond better than others, and that is a simply coincidence. Esentially Telekinisis.</p><br>
<h2><a id="zenith">External Manifestation</a></h2><p>Can create physical objects with a 10 by 10 by 1 foot source of material. They can create forcefields with that material, as thick or thin as nessecary, or blades with the material, or armor, or a sheild. They can do whatever they wish with it, and color it/make it glow with emotion. More material comes with higher levels. The material is virtually indestructable.<br>
