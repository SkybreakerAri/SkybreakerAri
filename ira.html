  <h1>Ira Avory Keneshke</h1><p>Ira Avory Keneshke is a male Anarchian about 16 years old. He has short purple hair that fills out with dark violet at the roots, coursing down to a light periwinkle at the very tips. He had dark olive skin with pointed ears and firm slanted piercing crystal blue eyes. All of this made up for a gentleman who looked, and was, older than his years. He had the calm, yet stern, look of an Anakatens. Anakatens were close to nature and exceptionally fast. He is, however, the big brother of the group, and gives in to fun sometimes. He likes to wear Jean's, a zip-up jacket, and a t-shirt. 
His Skill is one that I, honestly, love. It is telepathy (Internal Telesthesia)Problem is, he is an excellent liar and a very powerful individual. Remember how I said that he and Trineasha were some of the most powerful beings in the galaxy? I think I will keep it, but most of the members underestimate him because he plays it down. He tells them that he will stay on the ship during battles to have complete concentration, as well as because he is terrified of being out there. Lies. He knows how to fight - and fight well, at that - and needs no specific conditions to use his powers. He deserves his own book because he has already had his arcs. He stays at the ship and mentally fights, but he also works on the device to bring Trineasha’s memories back. 
You know his little backstory, but I shall scribe it for later reference and editing. He and Trineasha are brother and sister, and both have an opposing Skill in the Telesthesia sector. This means that they are a very natural pair. Any two people with high enough rankings can pair up, but it takes a lot less practice to bond to someone in your same sector, as they are. They would have paired a long while back, perhaps when they were children, and they just played around with it then. Think of Anna and Elsa’s flashbacks, except Anna has powers too, and accidents happened way more often. They always figured it out, but they did happen. I'm not quite sure why they got their powers so early on, it might have been the fact that they were already being raised with the ideals, they were raised by the Guardians because of an arrangement, or it might have simply been because the Guardians were experimenting with how beings would react when given the powers at a very young age. Either way, when they finally got their Guardians, probably around teens, 15-17 years old (in literal terms, not the fact that Ira is 16 while at the same time 243), Trineasha was excited; she was never a fan of Anakata because her powers, in particular, are limited without inanimate objects to use it on, and she is eager to explore the galaxy. Ira is more cautious because Anakata is all that he has ever known, but then again, he knew they wouldn’t leave for a while - Valorians haven’t fully started up by then, and if there aren’t any Valorians, there aren’t any Forsaken. So they kept practicing and were helped along by their guardians, both dragons. Trineasha’s is a smaller one that can grow in size, but usually stays the size of a terrible terror, while Ira’s is a very large dragon that can simply camouflage in the air. They trained hard, and eventually became good enough to start defending the Allied Planets against the budding enemy. They were the first, and then came along the rest of the crew, which includes Sirus and Zayden, but I will need to plan out the rest. Over time, fighting and getting a lot of hands-on lessons, they became two of the more powerful beings in the galaxy (the Epitomes) and worked completely cohesively together. They can access each other’s surroundings when paired, though Ira can only see the minds and Trineasha can only see the physical objects. You have to remember that meshing together their powers for literally as long as they have had them does strange things to the individuals. They are far more used to using their combined powers than using their own, though they were extensively trained in/with all of the Skills. They are each a half of the other mentally. One day, the war started to get heated, and casualties went up as they had not before. On one battle, in particular, the Forsaken rose up and fought hard, specifically focusing on taking down the Epitomes, knowing that if one fell, the other would too, and the battle would be lost to them. That day, as they fought side by side, Ira died, or got extraordinarily close to it. Trineasha collapsed, surrounded by her army in shock. People started dying in large numbers, and Trineasha starts to spiral deeper and deeper, thoughts challenging the very nature of her Ideal. She is completely wrecked, and refuses to accept the death of her brother; half of her died with him, after alltoIn complete defiance of anything the Valorians stand for, and uncaring of the consequences, she reaches within herself and does the impossible, fueled by emotion. She becomes the Zenith. Not two seconds after she does though, her Guardian blackens, shrinking and turning into a mostly mindless black fox thing with a scaly back and wings. He died mentally, but only mostly physically. She starts to blackout, but holds herself together forcefully, only nearly holding on to her goal and anger. She considers bringing Ira back, but acknowledges the toll that will take on her, so she first uses the powers to create a circle of destruction around them, killing all enemies first with a mental check, then with fast-moving sheets and daggers of ice. She got on a floating force field, soaring about the battle and killing all Forsaken, unknowing that that was what she had become. The enemy was decimated in a matter of minutes, but she still felt the rage of injustice and love burn inside her, and with all of her newfound power, she was hardly winded. The last thing she remembers is kneeling beside Ira, placing a hand on his chest, and willing her strength to him. Because of magic, this works just fine, especially since I don't think he was fully dead.
