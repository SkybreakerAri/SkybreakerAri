  <h1>Lilly Anna Sandstar</h1><p>Lilly Anna Sandstar is a 13, almost 14, year old girl that is one of the protagonists. She has wavy honey brown hair that cuts off jaggedly at the shoulders as if she had cut it herself (and she did) She often wears her hair up in a middling ponytail with a baseball cap declaring her latest obsession. She has reddish hazel eyes that have a very soft hue, which can make her eyes appear either very big, warm, and kindly, or to be alight with flames, depending on her mood. Her skin is a light tan speckled with freckles from head to toe. 
She has a dark blue necklace with light purple lines swirling through it. These purple lines are never in the same place, and if you were to stare into them you could lose track of time just watching the intricate patterns ebb and flow. This is no ordinary necklace, as you might tell, it is, in fact, a hollowed-out amethyst, and in that day and age, all gemstones had a purpose for each half of the manipulative Sector. 
Her character is very happy, a little pushy, bouncy, and more than a tad eccentric. This is the personality everyone sees, at least. Often it is reflected inside, but she can be quite serious and protective when provoked. She is a tad immature, and for all of her goofiness,  she is an incredible fighter. Natasha has regrets fighting, and feels sorrow for those she hurts or kills. Lilly, however, feels no remorse; those people tried to harm her friends, and that can not be forgiven. Also, note that she can store any of her emotions, so she has no reason to be upset. She knows what is being stored, but as a general rule, she brushes most emotions off if she has no concrete reason to keep them. This is a reason why she is so good at fighting - she simply siphons off her fear and regret, leaving anger and only some compassion for a reason. 
The backstory is as follows: both of her biological parents are human, and both of them came to Markaia. She has 4 siblings: a 16-year-old brother named Henry, a 14, almost 15-year-old, a brother named Zach(ary), whom she is quite close with, a 10-year-old brother named Filren, and an 8-year-old Sister named Annabelle. The Markaiens resent her large family, as it is unconventional on Markaia. She does not know she is a Valorian, but she was given her Amulet on the trip when they stopped by Anakata, as Laina did not have an Amulet at the time. The Amulet blocks her head from being messed with overly much, so her memories were only scattered. The Radio does not work on her either. She remembers being Natasha's friend, and strives to achieve it again.
Favorite things are as follows: friends, people, |books, movies, TV shows|(when she finds out about them), and a meaningful adventure of discovery with friends.
Dislikes/pet peeves are as follows: facts, bullies, soldiers,  Markaiens, and she is terrified of mechanics.
