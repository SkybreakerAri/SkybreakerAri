  <h1>Kat'tinna Rak'kel Quantelra Sysara Lyenden</h1><p>Kat’tinna Rak'kel Qantelra Sysara Lyenden - Kat’tinna is a 17-year-old Kyenren with black, coal-colored skin, white freckles, and fingernails, yellow eyes, and very curly black hair with red purple at the tips. She keeps her hair in very tight braids, and puts that in a couple of loose half-backs. She is about 5’3, with a very muscular and compact frame. She has peaked eyebrows, giving her a perpetually serious/angry face. She likes to wear her tight magnetic loops around her wrists, which keep her weapons on her hands like the HeatRaiders. She also likes to keep small beads attached to these loops, which she can use to store or retrieve various attributes. She also wears her earrings of attributes. Her preferred outfit is mocahaskins, trousers, a sturdy long shirt, and some bits of armor that her brother gave her. She always has her belt. Her belt holds anything she needs to hunt, including a med-pack, knives, and anything else she deems necessary. She loves the hunt, and is the most skilled hunter, prowler, and fighter of the group when she joins, Eventually, Ira coaxes her to teach them. She is NEVER without her tools and knives, including when she sleeps, especially since she needs to store attributes at night. She was taught by Sirus the opposite of her planet’s normal. She was taught to be strong and fierce, but also to be humble and ever-compliant to her master. Because of this, while she absolutely dominates a room when she enters it, including the team, she is completely subservient to Ira. She never grovels, for goodness sakes, but will do what he askes readily, though she will ask questions if it seems completely unforeseen, and offer her opinion when asked. She never gives a problem to him because the last thing Sirus said when she left was that he was her master, and she trusts him, and Sirus more. She does not necessarily act the same towards Natasha; Ira she was commanded to follow by Sirus, while Natasha has to earn Kat’tinna’s loyalty, whether Ira points her towards her or not. She acknowledges, however, that Natasha is also a leader. She often acts unconsciously as an escort or bodyguard in a public place with Ira or Natasha. 
Ah, her glorious past. So, a little bit about her older brother, Sirus. So Sirus was part of Ira's team, and got the message when Ira told him to survive another day instead of be killed. Either way, the guardian would die, but if he surrendered and kept his ideals, and asked permission of the Superiors and his own Guardian, it could be brought back. I'll talk about that elsewhere - probably in the Magic System doc. So Sirus goes through this whole trial and gives up his bond… okay I'll go more into the nature of bonds because I just came up with these tenuous rules, and it needs a tad more explaining for this backstory. So. Alright. You need to be of a certain Tier to bring your Guardian back within a reasonable time if it was already decided, let’s call it a purposeful decoy. See, if a
