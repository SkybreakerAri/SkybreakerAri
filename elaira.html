  <h1><strong>Elaira Karla Benats</h1><p>Elaira Karla Benats is a 17-year-old female Zigbreen. Her eyes are a solid magenta with black eyeliner and eyelashes. Her skin is a light, slightly translucent, floral pink. Her hair is a very light blue, and in a pixie cut. She wears tall black boots with movable ankles, leggings, an ankle-length loose skirt that doesn’t restrain her at all, a tucked-in long-sleeve, lace-up hoodie kind of shirt. It has long sleeves, long enough to conceal her gloved hands, tight enough to look fashionable, laced up over an undershirt, and has a soft hood that shadows her face. She wears a long, fine Gerudo-like mask to cover the rest of her face and neck. She used to be a farmer in her country, and worked hard, but once her family discovered she had bonded her Guardian, Jalaius, they banished her, turning her in to the authorities. She escaped, using her force fields as a reflector and safe place. She escaped, running hard into the country for days, as far away from the central city as she could, until she eventually collapsed from exhaustion and lack of everything on some farmer’s land. One of his sons brought her in from the field, and she stayed there for a good long while, hiding as the country searched high and low for her. The farmer was an old Valorian who did not approve of Trineasha’s new rule, and gladly gave her refuge. She helped out, getting to know one of the boys well. Not romantically, just as a friend. She told them her name was Karla, since she didn’t trust them with her real name, and she later kept that name because it reminded her of the kindness some people have, as well as being a disguise. After a long time, she took her leave of their family, taking their advice and getting as far from her country as she could, searching for a free country to bunk down in. She was still looking when Trineasha got ahold of her. She stayed perhaps three or four months at the farmer’s house, then traveled for several more months, so we can say she had been a Valorian for a year when Trineasha caught her. She is obedient, but only in a Loki sense. She followed Trineasha when she was captured only because she knew fighting hard would get her nowhere. She didn’t take it easily, of course, and fought every step of the way, but did it eventually, and did it well. She fought, but she was one of the best, and though she hated Trineasha and her arrogant air with all she had, she fought well because of the anger and direction. Eventually, once Trineasha had cooled down a bit, relearning how to be a leader, she pulled Karla aside for a private talk. She told Karla that she was top of the class, but if she didn’t stop being a jerk, Trineasha would have to dispose of her, because she caused dissension in the ranks, and would do her no good, if she kept fighting against instead of for. Karla erupted with all of her oppressed emotions, and Trineasha listened, half because she really did want to help the people, half because she didn’t want to lose such a valuable asset. Trineasha told Karla all she knew about her rage towards the Valorians, and Karla finally understood her contempt. She gave Trineasha some pointers on leading, and vowed to be her new Internal Manifestor, as repent for fighting, as well as to keep her life and prove her worth. Karla agreed with her view at this point, and was eager to fix her mistakes for a good cause. She had to kill some of her teammates, and it taught her not to grow so attached to her friends that she wouldn’t betray them in a heartbeat for the good of the Empire. Enter Cyjan, who, like I said, becomes good friends with her. It is tentative at first, but they talk because of their shared heritage, their skin. They are both amazing fighters, and, obviously, in the same Sector, so they are together a lot, and the more they are, the more powerful they are as a unit. He is one of the few people that can get her to smile, after all that has happened to her, and she enjoys deeply fighting him. He, along with the rest of Trineasha’s guards, are very skilled, and she truly enjoys the fight, the competition. It was why she succeeded as well as she did; if there is a fight, she refuses to be beaten, even if it causes her pain to practice enough to beat them. Cyjan can fight as well as she, and she enjoys the lengthy spars they conduct. However, she is well aware that at any time, she could be sent to kill any of her comrades for treason or betrayal, and so despite her love of them, she would do it in a heartbeat. Where Cyjan is dedicated to Trineasha’s mission, Karla is doggedly loyal to her for her. The fact that Trineasha was vulnerable lets Karla trust her, as does the fact that that she hasn’t killed Karla yet, and her vision and attitude -- it all lets Karla be loyal without restraint. She is eager to please, if the person is worth it. This is why she follows Trineasha, even once she is healed, because she always followed the person, not the mission, and is one of the very few that accept Trineasha for who she is once she gets her memories back. This is where she and Cyjan split. Cyjan goes to lead a rebellion, Karla goes to protect Trineasha as she recovers from such a blunt blow. Her character arc is from farm girl, to culturally adept and street-wise girl who is too frightened and defensive for her age. She covers every inch of her skin, embarrassed and incriminated by her skin, terrified of what people will do when they find out who she is, even though she hasn’t done anything. When she is found by Trineasha, she is defensive and angry, yet submissive all the same. She doesn’t go down easily, but she is deathly afraid of physical harm and, well, death, and will do what she is commanded to, in the end. Once she understands Trineasha’s vision, and that she could literally have been killed at any time for any reason, she trusts her leader a lot more, and learns to laugh, to put her life in someone else’s hands, to protect them at all costs. She finds a new identity in the label “bodyguard” and takes it to heart. She loves the challenge, and will gladly fight anyone for any reason. She always has energy with which to fight. Eventually, some signs of her development, she chooses to be called Elaira again, stepping out of anonymousness, and starts wearing more revealing clothes -- not inappropriate, just ones that allow her to move more comfortably, or that don’t leave her sweltering. She drops the hood and mask during training, and only uses them on assassin missions.
