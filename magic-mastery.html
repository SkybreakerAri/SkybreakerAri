<h1 style="color:white">Mastery Levels</h1><p>Hmm so for this one, I have more information. There will be levels of mastery in the Valorian unit, as the Warrior grows closer and closer to the ideal of their Skill, and more, well, Valoriant, and in control of their power. I am simply going to copy and paste a definition I discovered at like ten at night this one time, when I thought I would never let it see the light of day. So this will be... characterized. I will edit it severely later. It made sense to my sleep-deprived brain at the time, alright?<br> each Skill has its own prospect, and it may vary even still within the members. However, there are a few laws and guidelines they must all follow:<br>
You may never be bonded to two people who are not bonded to each other. <br>
You must have some ritual to break and open a bond, and perform each respectively before opening or closing a bond. <br>
You must always stay by the code of your Sector. <br>
You must do all with the consent of your Guardian if it affects the both of you.<br><br>

Guardians "die" when one or more of these offenses are breached, or if the Superiors deem it necessary. However, this seems a cruel price to pay, especially since the majority of fault falls squarely on the shoulders of the Warrior. While yes, sometimes the Guardian broke off the chain of command and bonded rougely in the first place, I feel like it would be an oversight for the Superior's team to keep dying off because of random offenses, and it wouldn't make sense for them to keep doing it if their supply kept diminishing. Once a Guardian goes Incorporeal-- bear with me now. I had an idea, but it is somewhat trademarked. This is the best part about never publishing a book for real - I can copyright all I want, knowing that I'm just using it as a basis for building, because I can't develop without a clue of what I'm doing in life. So. Once a Valorian breaks their code, and the Superiors deem it an offense worthy of a Guardian going Incorporeal (note that these high beings do this in a couple eye blinks), the Valorian goes Forsaken, losing their ability to bond to others, and the Guardian turns Incorporeal, though whether or not I… right. One second. So. We are hard borrowing from Stormlight here, but basically, once a Guardian goes Incorporeal, it is akin to an intelligent spren going from Shadesmar (the Cognitive realm) to the physical realm in the fact that they lose their ability to think, and have very little power associated with them until… later… yeah. Oh man I'm going to need to edit this so hard. So now I am faced with the problem of what happens when a person attracts an Incorporeal, and how Valorians can find and gain them back, and what that whole process looks like. I mean, you could absolutely trap an Incorporeal in a gem or something, then release it when its safe to, that works, but hmm… and of course, if a Valorian dies, the Guardian simply goes back to their headquarters. But there are far too many times when a Valorian breaks their code and doesn't care or know how to retrieve their Guardian, and they simply… float off, think spren. I need to figure out if they can be recognized and how, and what offenses count for what level of whatever. So many things to plan. I LOVE IT. Let's see… At this point it is mainly questions for later, more creative and responsible me. Because we all know that's so true (HAH). Now. What is the difference between a random person with the right potential trying to bond an Incorporeal and its past Warrior (now Forsaken) trying to bond it? Answer: Only the Warrior that was a part of the bond can retrieve their dead Guardian, unless they die; if they die, any worhty person can bond them. Are Valorians who have bonded Incorporeals somehow different than Valorians who bonded live ones?  Truely, it should be the same process, but the Tier one is the second Tier, with the first one being spent trying to bring the Incorporeal back. Maybe? But the question still stands of how exactly you do that. Not ignoring it is one thing. Nya, so we can't totally take spren, because… just no. I'd ruin a beautiful thing. But I can't really make them possess an animal, perhaps not unless they had a certain standing… does it matter what ranks you had when turned Incorporeal? Do the higher ranks entitle higher or lower consciousness if killed? Incorporeals are, well, incorporeal, we know that, but what does that mean? Are they a mist that surrounds a certain object? Now, that might work. They may or may not be inside the object… YAS OKAY. So. When a Guardian dies, its spirit turns into an Incorporeal that either inhabits or hangs around a certain object of their dying choice, while their body, an animal, simply runs off to make a life for itself, and it truly is just another strange-looking animal unless their spirit finds them again. This is pretty rare, so the Valorians that have Guardians are therefore different from Valorians with Incorporeals. So Lilly's necklace? That was her Guardian turned Incorporeal when Trineasha went through and broke their bonds. Laina? That was its body that hid ans returned to Natasha by chance. It should have stayed with Lilly, but since its an animal, it really couldn't decide any major plot points, save for finding Natasha. Mmm so. I need to write this down. If a Warrior is trying to rebond their Guardian, the first Tier is spent coaxing the Incorporeal out of their shell - literally. I have to figure out the basics of this, but I think that they would have to do something that fit with the order very strongly. This might be an odd idea, but since the amulet, or bracelet, or random container or charm could hold an Incorporeal, it has certain abilities, however limited they are. It would really only lend a very small trickle of power until the person shows an ability to abide by the Secter’s rules, intentionally or not. Once they do something worth noticing, probably something big, the Guardian comes to life inside of its container, or it just stays with the person. It is essentially as a normal Tier one. If they are rebonding their old Warrior, then at Tier two, their memory comes back, and if they wanted to, they could return the Incorporeal to its body. If it is a new person bonding, then their memory does not come back at Tier Two, though they may pick a new body. <br> I feel like, if we are naming them “Valorians”, each Skill should be based on a certain ideal - but not in that way. I want to call the different “Ideals”, or moments you move on to another level, Criterion, while the existing of one in that Criterion is an Echelon . The most experienced Valorian - Guardian and Warrior pair -, whether it is a teacher or active combatant, it is named an Epitome. Ira and Trineasha were once an Epitomic Pair. I feel like it should be something perhaps quite general, like the Water element can also be known as … the Preservation Skill, or something like that. I don’t necessarily need to write out oaths, but there will definitely be a certain mental motif within the personality of the Warriors. No spoken oaths - that’s trademarked. I think it would simply be a sudden culmination of ideas in a head. Think… they suddenly know how to do something new. It is like in a game, where even if you know how to do something, you can’t because you’re not ready. It’s like that. You understand yourself and your power more integrally, and know what you can do to better uphold it. You literally cannot do something until you are ready to uphold the burden of knowing it. <br>
This is something I like about my magic system so far; mistakes are rarely made. In most books, its the whole problem of “Am I ready for this?” “Was I mischosen?” and all that stuff. Makes for a wonderful story, but I like the more utilitarian way of looking at it. Think: if you were on a council that decided what people got powers and what didn’t, would you randomly assign Guardians to people, and hope dearly that they knew what they were doing? Mmmm maybe not. See, what I like about this system is the fact that everything is quite rational. There is a 1st Echelon specifically for this purpose. This is where a Guardian - upon finishing training successfully -  will pick a person and hand them a watered-down version of their powers. They then sit and watch for a good long while, gauging whether or not they are worthy, and how they are using their powers. Usually, they bring their findings to the head of the group for analyses, but sometimes they go off their gut feeling, and that is accepted as well - after all, they are the ones who get hurt the most if their charge goes rouge. I love how structured it is. Out with the irrational! Even if you have the most irresponsible Warrior of the group, the failsafe is that they literally cannot progress until they are ready, so these Ousiders are odd. See, at one point, they were Valorians, and they could have been quite high. They honestly did mean what they said or felt for their Criterion. However, like Trineasha, things happen. If you break your tacit oath, you doom yourself and your Guardian. You are pushed from the order, but you still know how to do things, and that makes you dangerous. You no longer have to obey the orders of your Sector, or even of the Valorians as a whole, but you also cannot Pair. So now, you have this band of elites trying to either make their own life or wreak havoc, unable to join the Valorians casually. It depends on why they left. If they left for reasons like Trineasha, often they are simply reclusive. HowveThe Guardians are quite vehement towards them and their kind, though that is simply because they left. They can be accepted back in, but it takes much more work than it would normally be, because the Guardians are all quite suspicious of them, and do not trust them to not break their oaths again. I need to decide whether or not losing access to their Criterion Pair-wise includes Guardians or not. 
When a Valorian becomes an Outsider, their Guardian dies. When a Guardian dies, it manifests as something, depending on the Skill, it may manifest as a varity of things. With proper care and attendence, it can be brought back, and the manifestation itself can bring certain "luck" or powers. </p>
